# React Native Project Setup

## **1. Start the Metro Server**

To begin, start **Metro**, the JavaScript bundler for React Native. Run the following command from the _root_ of the project:

```bash
npm start
# OR
yarn start
```

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal.

---

## **2. Run the Application**

### **For Android**

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
npm run android
# OR
yarn android
```

### **For iOS**

(Requires macOS with Xcode installed)

```bash
npm run ios
# OR
yarn ios
```

---

If everything is set up correctly, your app should launch in the **Android Emulator**, **iOS Simulator**, or on a connected device.
